# Gas-Web-Scraping
Scrape price data on items from local gas stations

These scripts record and plot price data from local gas stations identified in the csv file 

The "Store_Info.csv" file contains each respective item's url for the script to navigate the browser too. 

Requirements: 
Install python 3. 

Install the following with pip: 
1. datetime
2. pandas
3. plotly
4. requests_html

Within a python command terminal, run "main.py" to start the data recording script or "plotter.py" to create a plot of the results

Note: The prices captured are intended to be used as a personal reference and may not be accurate to what your local store's prices are / current sale price. 
Note: The prices are scraped from Google, not the store's website.
